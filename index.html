          About Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi The sacred city of Anuradhapura has been
          nominated by UNESCO as a World Heritage. The main reason for the
          historical city of Anuradhapura to become a sacred city was the Jaya
          Sri Maha Bodhi. This sacred tree has been planted in the historical
          Maha Megha Vana Royal Park in Anuradhapura in the month of ‘Unduvap’
          (December), 236 BC, according to the written facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sacred Bodhi sapling has been ceremonially brought here by Arahant
          Sanghamitta Maha Theree, under the instructions of Arahant Mihindu
          Maha Thero. King Devanampiyatissa who ruled Sri Lanka in this period
          planted this Bodhi tree with great pageantry in the Maha Megha Vana
          Royal Park dedicated to the venerable bhikkhus. The present age of the
          Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is 2,247 years. Accordingly, the
          oldest tree in the whole world with a written history is the Jaya Sri
          Maha Bodhi of Anuradhapura.

        <h3>Sri Padaya</h3>
        <img src="img/sripadaya.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width: 100%" />
        <p>
          The climb to Sri Padaya or Adam’s Peak Mountain in Sri Lanka’s hill
          country is just a magical experience. It’s a magnificent creation of
          nature that has been respected for centuries. The sunrise here is
          absolutely spectacular. To witness this breath-taking site, you will
          have to start the climb at midnight and continue it all night long to
          be there by dawn. People of all ages in Sri Lanka climb the Adam’s
          Peak Mountain as a yearly pilgrimage, and they never get enough of
          this amazing experience. Visitors to Sri Lanka admit that it could be
          the most amazing sunrise view in all of Sri Lanka, or perhaps even in
          all of Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top of the mountain has a huge “footprint”. The Buddhists of Sri
          Lanka believe that it’s the footprint of Lord Buddha’s left foot. The
          Hindus claimed that the footprint belonged to Lord Shiva. Its English
          name – Adam’s Peak – stresses the belief of the Muslims and the
          Christians that it’s the first place that Adam set foot on Earth after
          leaving Heaven.
